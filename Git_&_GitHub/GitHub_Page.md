* Imagine Git as the workflow to get things done and GitHub and GitHub Pages as places to store the work you finish. 
* `Git` is a version control system that tracks changes to files in a project over time.
* `GitHub` is a web hosting service for the source code of software and web development projects (or other text based projects) that use Git. 
* `GitHub Pages` are public webpages hosted for free through GitHub. GitHub users can create and host both personal 
websites (one allowed per user) and websites related to specific GitHub projects. Pages lets you do the same things 
as GitHub, but if the repository is named a certain way and files inside it are HTML or Markdown, you can view the 
file like any other website. GitHub Pages is the self-aware version of GitHub.
