    * `x[::2]`  # every other element
    * `x[1::2]` # every other element, starting at index 1
    * A potentially confusing case is when the `step` value is negative. In this case, the defaults for
    `start` and `stop` are swapped. This becomes a convenient way to reverse an array.
    * `x[::-1]` reverse array `x`.
